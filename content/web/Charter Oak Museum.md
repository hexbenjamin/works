## Brief
To support the release of Dom McLennon's first body of work after the dissolution of BROCKHAMPTON, an EP entitled *Prologue*, I was tasked with creating a website that would act as a replacement for a mini-documentary that had been planned.

The interview-styled audio for the documentary had been recorded, but instead of recording video to go with it, we decided to create a website. Our goal was to allow users to listen to the audio while exploring an environment that was inspired by the artwork for the EP and its planned follow-up: the LP *The Changing Of The Trees*.

## Design
The site's layout is deliberately much larger than the viewport of the user's browser, and relies on both horizontal and vertical scrolling to be navigated. This was done with a "mobile-first" mindset, as most of the traffic to the site would be coming through Dom's social media channels.

The page uses a tiled background of purple bricks, sampled directly from the artwork for *The Changing Of The Trees*, and features a grid of antique picture frames, each containing artwork from the release campaign. The frames glow a little when hovered over, and several play clips of the documentary audio when clicked. Small placards act as links out to the *Prologue* EP on streaming services, credits for the project, and a subtle release date announcement for *TCOTT*.

I wrote the site using [Reflex](https://reflex.dev), a Python library that allowed me to write in the language I have the most familiarity with and then compile valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for use in production.
